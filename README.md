It then uses visualizations and regressions to analyze the relationships between geographical and weather conditions. The VacationPy script utilizes the Geoapify API and and user preferences to map the hotels located in ideal weather conditions of the user.

For WeatherPy, I used class activities and referred to my work in previous homeworks. For VacationPy, I used class activities as a resouce. I also used the HvPlot documentation (https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Customization.html) to figure out how to add information to the map label with "hover_cols".
